Crossing the line into the other side
Emerging as prisoners
To the emptiness of time.
To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight.
Plunging into a newfound
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage.
Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory.
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew
Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes.
Was it overlooked in front of all our faces?.
Now, all the mistakes and secrets
Cannot be erased.
Viewing the blind complexity
By which laws were justified.
To erase simplicity
To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight.
Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage.
Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory.
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew.
Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes
We are enslaved now...




 Creating a life only to destroy
Saved from a life of the unemployed.
Where crime is the only way to survive
Which is the best to be dead or alive?.
Maybe a chance but maybe not
Born to be thrown in the trash to rot.
To exist in this world might be a mistake
The one who is with child
It's their choice to make.
Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong
Whose choice will it be?.
Abortion
When it is needed
Execution
For those who deserve it.
The giving and taking of life
Will always be.
Altering the future.
Look into the future
To prepare us for our fate
Controlling our existence
With every life we take.
Life for a life should remain the rule
The innocent victim that is what's cruel.
Look to the past is what we should do
When justice was done and justice was true.
Using our laws to help their escape
An easy way out is what they create.
Claiming insane is the way to freedom
People are stupid enough to believe them.
Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong
Whose choice will it be?.
Abortion
When it is needed
Execution
For those who deserve it.
The giving and taking of life
Will always be.




 I would describe it as an invisible darkness
Casting a shadow, a blinding black
Guarded by hope, my soul is kept safe
From the bloody claws.
Look to beyond, what vision lets me see
Time after time, unneeded misery.
My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight.
Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands.
Your turn to ask why
Life is like a mystery
With many clues, but with few answers.
To tell us what it is that we can do to look
For messages that keep us from the truth.
Look to beyond, what vision lets me see
Time after time, unneeded misery.
My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight.
Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands.
Your turn to ask why
Oh God, why?.




 Under command a new-born child
Submerged in blood, The dead they smile.
Growing possessed, Burning inside
A bloody feast for us tonight.
The way of death
Is growing here, just take my hand.
Skies grow black
Unholy corpses upon their land.
The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found.
Possessed, The child shall kill
The future is now revealed.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.
Gather around, Watch and see
A new creation of misery.
Taking the place of the elderly dead
Forbidden ways now in his head.
The way of death
Is growing here just take my hand.
Skies grow black
Unholy corpses upon their land.
The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found.
Possessed, The child shall kill
The future is now revealed.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.
Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn.




 Messenger of evil
Haunting your soul
Laying in peace
Taking my corpse.
Demeaning it was hell
Drink it all to death.
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Screaming in silence
Withing mistery
Inside is spilled
With your brain.
Demeaning it was hell
Drink it all to death.
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.
Beyond the unholy grave.




 Look down at the body!
You may see no trace of wounds
But in the eye
The eye of the beholder
One cannot assume.
Not a drop of blood is drawn
But you know how it bleeds.
Beware of the sharp edged weapon
Called human being.
It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill.
I will not feed your hunger
Instead, I bite the pain.
Looking not back, but forward
I bite down.
Try to cover up the trail of deceit
And daggers spawned from your soul.
Acid, the tears of remorse
Flow in vain, too late for regrets.
Save it
For the next ill-fated game.
It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill.
I will not feed your hunger
Instead, I bite the pain.
Looking not back, but forward
I bite down.




 Brought to this world to wither away
Naive about the ways of life is what they say.
Millions live millions die, more are yet to come
Living skeletons - Where they come from.
Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony.
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, why can't you see.
Life of misery
Soon a corpse you be.
As bones show through
Nothing you can do.
Relief does not exist
When you are born to die.
Disease spreads fast across their dying world
Many cemeteries they will have to build.
As process goes on for many years to come
A human waste land created when they are done.
Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony.
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, why can't you see.




 Freedom is just a breath away
Will you live to see the day.
As the heat intensifies
You start to choke, your insides fry.
Seizure now sets in
Torture will begin.
Twisted bodies lie
Waiting now to die.
Choke on it
As your tongue goes down
Choke on it
Death is all around.
Screaming fills your frenzied mind
No way out no more time.
Example made from those to see
Your freedom turned to misery.
World is all around
Of what they have found.
Lesson to be learn
You will not return.
Choke on it
As your tongue goes down.
Choke on it
Death is all around.




 




 Built from blind faith
Passed down from self-induced fantasy.
Turn a page to justify
Conjuring power - it opens wide
On your seventh day.
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive
All that you want.
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your
Cross-turned dagger!!!.

Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form.
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn.
All the traps are set to confine
All who get in the way of the divine.
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite
A slave to the curse forever confined.

Shatter the myth
Don't cut yourself
On your words against
Dreams made of steel.
Stronger than any faith
That inflicts pain and fear
Is that how it's done?.
Twisting your eyes to perceive
All that you want.
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your
Cross-turned dagger.
Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form.
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn.




 One mind divided into three
For every problem a personality.
Each one trying to protect
For the crisis a person they'll select.
With sorrow comes reassurance
With confusion there's ignorance.
Deny who they are
A fantasy gone too far.
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities.
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities.
Passed down from generations
Years of pain and complication.
Darkness was a punishment
Memories time cannot mend.
Brutalised from the day of birth
To reality they can't return.
Existing in a world of three lives inside of one.
Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities.
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities.




 In your dreams
The pain is so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel.
Hear your future screams
See your epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh.
Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer.
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair.
Denial of life (Vile denial).
Denial of life.
Denial of life.
Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrificial suicide
End it with a knife.
Much too late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind.
Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer.
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair.
Denial of life (Vile denial).
Denial of life.
Denial of life.




 Time is a thing we must accept
The unexpected I sometimes fear.
Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens
Things fall into place.
I know there is no way to avoid
The pain that we must go through
To find the other half that is true.
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you and me.
I believe behind confusion
Awaits the truth for us
Past the obstacles we face
I value our life and trust.
Years of questioning
Why things happen the way they do in life
Wishing that I could turn back time
So we could join our souls.
I know there is no way to avoid
The pain that we must go through
To find the other half that is true.
Destiny is what we all seek.
Destiny was waiting for you and me.




 Ashes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change.
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind.
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others.
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined.
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?.
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words.
No escaping from those haunting
Empty words.
Do you ever feel it?
A craving that is so strong.
To by thought rewind in order to find
Expectations that shined through the doubt.
That soon would turn into the price
Of what a word will be worth.
When tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own-
And seeing what is real...
The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others.
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined.
Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?.
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words.
No escaping from those haunting
Empty words.




 Trapped inside a life
Which is not yours.
Spirits within causing terror
Fear and darkness.
Evil dead.
Evil dead.
Voice speaks out
All will die tonight.
Insanity fills your mind
You hear them calling.
Evil dead.
Evil dead.
Covered in blood
All hope is lost
Forever to rot.
Controlled by the powers of the
Evil dead.
Evil dead.




 Where is the person
That could have been
Who, what took over
When did the end begin.
Should we not prepare
For the uncertain
Mysteries of our life
Of our destiny.
See things that are not there
Intruding voices.
What went wrong
To their picture perfect life.
They once knew
Flattening of emotions.
A mind shared by
An uninvited stranger
Which comes and goes
As it choose to appear.
Should we not prepare
For the uncertain
Mysteries of our life
Of our destiny.
See things that are not there
Intruding voices.
What went wrong
To their picture perfect life.
They once knew
Flattering of emotions.




 Deep in your mind there is another side
A morbid truth one that cannot hide.
Unimaginable gore was your past time high
To hear people scream, to watch them die.
Return back to the burial site
Face your dreams upon this night.
Severed limbs not far away
Spirit past you now obey.
Images of the forgotten past
Your first life revealed at last.
Now you'll find to your surprise
All the corpses you left behind.
A place you feel you've been to before
Where life would turn right into gore.
You dig deep down through the years of decay
The truth is revealed, you found your way.
Return back to the burial site
Face your dreams upon this night.
Severed limbs not far away
Spirit past you now obey.
Images of the forgotten past
Your first life revealed at last.
Now you'll find to your surprise
All the corpses you left behind.




 Extending a life
With total resistance
To fatal disease
Future methods of science.
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed.
A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn.
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy.
Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production.
Producing a race
Of human machines
A new age of existence
The world will see.
Replacing what is real
By using technology
Population control
Selecting those who will breed.
A specific type of form
Chosen for the unborn.
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy.

 So quick to judge, so easily we forget
What it's like to be dissected
Where feelings are tossed aside.
Like a drug
It feeds the imagination of minds
That go unanalyzed.
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize.
Where is the invisible line that we must draw
To create individual thought patterns.
Prisoners of mental deception
Be free within singular judgement.
Twisting words to control the masses
To cover up one's self insecurities.
Like a drug
It feeds the imagination of minds
That go unanalyzed.
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize.




 Piling the bodies
Burn them in the night
Skin grows black and withered
Decayed smell will rise.
Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To Infernal death.
Human coals are burning
Repulsive yet so true
Open graves are scattered
When the work is through.
Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To Infernal death.
Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To Infernal death.




 People of the earth beware
It is here in human form.
An atrocity laced with greed
Filled with evil intentions
Ready to attack.
Look to the air for stories to choose
Who will be your next victim?.
Profitting on visions of others
Dark emotions run through its veins
Its motives are false its mind is insane.
A distant planet with no signs of life
To become a home for this alien breed
Scientists of the world unite
Your services are more than needed.
This creature in human form is out of control
Looks can be deceiving, see beyond the shell
Flesh and eyes mean nothing
The truth, time it will tell.
Before you think you fool the world
What comes around goes around.
Shown for what you are; a waste of life.
Look to the air for stories to choose
Who will be your next victim?.
Profitting on visions of others
Dark emotions run through its veins
Its motives are false its mind is insane.
A distant planet with no signs of life
To become a home for this alien breed
Scientists of the world unite
Your services are more than needed.
This creature in human form is out of control.




 What do you want from me
What is it you expect.
I have spoken my mind
From deep inside my soul.
Behind the eyes is a place
No one will be able to touch
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced.
You want what is not yours
Jealousy.
You want what you cannot have
Jealousy.
Spiteful harsh words
It comes as no real surprise
Tell me what you are.
I cannot understand
How you seem to exist
On what people create
For you, good must turn bad.
Behind the eyes is a place
No one will be able to touch
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced.
You want what is not yours
Jealousy.
You want what you cannot have
Jealousy.



 To the world around he was the perfect person
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing.
A human bomb just waiting to explode
This secret rage can't be controlled.
Slaughtered the dreams of others
On left to recover.
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed.
Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?.
Getting bored with his current life
Rearranging with a knife.
Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow.
His life was spared for this he does not know.
Screams filled the air there was no way to help
The ones he mourns he killed himself.
Slaughtered the dreams of others
On left to recover.
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed.
Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?.




 A condemning fear strikes down
Things they cannot understand.
An excuse to cover up
Weaknesses that lie within
Lies.
Laying your guilt and pain
On people that had no part
In the molding of a life
That creates its destruction
Lies.
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your part in the demise of a life.
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment.
Reaching into the minds of those that created
The depression in which they
In which they drowned their flesh and blood
Lies.
So easy to blame the
Everlasting guilt on a pathetic attempt
To justify the ending of life
Lies.
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your help in the end of a life.
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment.




 Mangled bodies falling from the sky
Grotesque mutation ripping out your eyes.
Now a corpses slave you'll learn to rot
A life of endless gore is what you've got.
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn.
In this land there is no night or day
In pools of blood, The corpses sit and prey.
Unholy carcass begging for relief
Existing everyday in morbid grief.
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn.
Searching for your soul
Nowhere to be found
Wanting to return
Six feet under ground.
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn.




 Put your life into their hands
Die for someone else
Now you're in the real world
Where pain and death are felt.
The first blood she'd does not seem real
Reality is what you feel.
Dropping to your knees you pray
God won't make this go away.
You will not return alive
Left to die.
Suffering until the end
Left to die.
Time stands still as you pass away
No more tomorrow
This is you last day
On this fucking earth.
Bodies fall onto the ground
Blood flies through the air
Shredded victims lie in pain
Death is never fair.
Legs blown off, all hope is lost
A human life is what it cost.
Others follow close behind
A real adventure they will find.
You will not return alive
Left to die.
Suffering until the end
Left to die.




 Bodies deformed way beyond belief
Cast out from their concerned society.
Flesh contorting day after day
Freak of the dark world is what the people say.
Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure.
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe
Death comes slow.
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest.
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take.
Tuberculoid the most severe
Decay of the nerves comes fast
Sense of feeling soon to be gone
Life will never last.
No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away
Damage is done you feel no more pain
Bones decay deterioration grows
Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows.
Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure.
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe
Death comes slow.
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take.




 Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation.
Breaking the mould of human appearance
Contorting bodies with chemical interference.
The guilty one
Innocent she now cries
A life of hell
Better off to die.
Born without eyes
Hands, and a half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine.
Living monstrosity
A freak for life they'll always be.
Never knowing love or hate
Only pain the drug creates.
Some say she's naive
She's a stupid bitch.
Some say to forgive
Guilty she should die.
The beginning of the end begins at birth
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh.
An example we should make out of these creators of misfortune
A serious crime that should not be forgiven.
The guilty one
Innocent she now cries
A life of hell
Better off to die.
Born without eyes
Hands, and a half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine.




 Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leaches all around
Looking superior is what they believe.
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent.
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie.
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see.
Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness.
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life.
A pathetic excuse for a human being
Nothing to back you up.
Never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world
Into seeing something you are not.
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent.
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie.
Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see.




 You see your vision and no one else's
Your every word filled with sarcasm.
Crucify people with invisible knowledge
Verbal destruction with each compulsion.
We will see where you go
The future for you is nowhere.
Every minute a cliché of your kind
Too much to say from a person with no respect.
Your accusations you will regret
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison.
Take away the power
A shallow person you will find.
What would you do without
Your pathetic narrow-minded approach to life
That reflects your lack of abilities.
Your opinions are self-destructive.
Despair is your gain, Delight is corruption
Destined to fall prey to your stories
Creating problems for your consumption.
We will see where you go
The future for you is nowhere.
Every minute a cliché of your kind
Too much to say from a person with no respect.
Your accusations you will regret
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison.
Take away the power
A shallow person you will find.




 From above and around
Observations are collected.
Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms
That may bring hope from beyond.
Beneath the giver of life, our sun
An examination of another kind is done.
A view from those who stood high
And breathing the sky
An opinion from below and from above.
Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, but none forgot.
Misanthrope
Hater of all mankind
There is some hope
For those who own their mind.
They came, they saw and acknowledged
Some good, some bad.
Opinion: dangerous
Stay where you are, don't get consumed
By what they created from sheer neglect.
In denial of years and years of
Shattered souls
That were lost to the power of
Fragile, frightful minds.
A view from those who stood high
And breathing the sky
An opinion from below and from above.
Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, But none forgot.
Misanthrope
Hater of all mankind
There is some hope
For those who own their mind.
They came, they saw and acknowledged
Some good, some bad.




 Massacred, Hacked to death, My revenge
Slicing deep, Into your flesh, The pain intense.
Dreams of hate, Misery, Fill my mind
Puke in your face in disgust, It's time to die.
You must die in pain.
You must die in pain.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Staring your severed head in the face
I celebrate a faggot's death, Human disgrace.
Hanging your mangled corpse for display
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day.
You must die in pain.
You must die in pain.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
You must die in pain.
You must die in pain.
You must die in pain.
You must die in pain.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.
Mutilation.




 Living like us and sharing our day
In another world very far away.
A different existence, yet virtually the same
Aggression is sadness and laughter is pain.
Look deep into their eyes for what they have to say
Emotions take control of life everyday.
Unpredictable variations of behavior
Hold the key to the mental door.
Where nothing is everything and everything is nothing
Staring beyond the wall a thousand times over.
Seeing a part of them that is real
Just imagine how it might feel.
To be denied of what life has to give
Behind mental shadows they must live.
Look deep into their eyes for what they have to say
Emotions take control of life everyday.




 Approach the image filled with fear
As the image grows so clear.
Future now takes full control
The one whose past you now behold.
Touch - the flesh it is so cold
Turn away - you now have been told.
Never to return, memories will last
In the future, you'll think about the past.
Never to forget, what you have seen
People come to pay respect
Taking pictures of the dead
That is what life comes to be.
Once they lived, now they're deceased.
Death is oh so strange
The past no one can change.
What you can't predict
Is how long you'll exist.
Open casket - open casket
Life will never be the same
Death can never be explained.
It's their time to go beyond
Empty feeling when they're gone.
Never to return, memories will last
In the future, you'll think about the past.
Never to forget, what you have seen
What can not be real you now believe.




 Trapped in a lost world of brutality.
So weak are the ones that must rely on shock
To push this so called force that inspires their call.
To be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch.
Say what you want
I know the truth.
When it comes to your kind
In time we'll see who lasts.
In time you will disappear
Who are you to question my sincerity.
For now you are high on yourself
Drowning in your dreams of misguided hope.
To be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch.




 Your existence is a script
Life for you is a performance.
Play out the leading role
Directing and premeditating every move
That creates the act of manipulation.
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addiction.
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shell.
Existing in dimensions of addictive obsession.
Your script will run short of ideas
The story will soon end itself.
People to trust come short in number
Like a plague your lies spread
Fast across the world.
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addiction.
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shell.




 The journey begins with curiosity
And evolves into soul-felt questions.
On the stones that we walk
And choose to make our path
Sometimes never knowing
Other times knowing too much.
Filtering out the bad that holds us back.
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain.
Won't you join me on the perennial quest
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light.
Search for answers on the perennial quest
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test.
No time for mental crutches
The maker has moved on.
I will take it raw and be on my way
Those that stood beside me.
I'm glad you understand
Behind these written words
I share the simple plan.
To hang on to the way that we feel
From rivers of sorrow
To oceans deep with hope.
I have travelled them
Now, there's no turning back
The limit, the sky.
I ask my questions: Why? What today?
When tomorrow?.
Filtering out the bad that holds us back.
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain.
Won't you join me on the perennial quest
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light.
Search for answers on the perennial quest
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test.




 Go against the ways and experience pain
Leading a life which one might call insane.
Bathe in the blood of the one you killed
Slaughter to survive, your needs are fulfilled.
Using horrid waste
Some of them will taste.
Removing deadly disease
With such primitive ease.
Cannibals practicing
The art of butchery.
Emotions don't exist
Pain you can't resist
Primitive ways.
Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones
While having an outer body experience.
Celebrate the kill of the day
Then walk among the guts of the fallen prey.
Using horrid waste
Some of them will taste.
Removing deadly disease
With such primitive ease.
Cannibals practicing
The art of butchery.
Emotions don't exist
Pain you can't resist.




 Memories is all that's left behind
As I lay and wait to die.
Little do they know
That I hear their choice of life.
End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say.
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope - Why don't you
Pull the plug.
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this way.
Once I had full control of my life
I now behold a machine decides my fate
End it now it's all too late.
What has now been days, it seems like years
To stay like this is what I fear.
Life ends so fast, so take your chance
And make it last.
End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say.
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope - Why don't you
Pull the plug.
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this way.




 Suicidal preacher hangs himself
Unfaithful servant goes straight to hell.
When he returns, your life will end
Down from the skies maggots descend.
Least expecting his horrible face
Your decayed guts you soon will taste.
Unholy feeling grows deep inside
Choking on your guts you open wide.
Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed.
Visions of death are growing clear
Life as a corpse is what you fear.
Searching through the graves to be set free
From the curse of the priest that's come to be.
So unaware of what's to come
Your guts are his when he is done.
Reaching for your cross to end this pain
Your life and blood he will have drained.
Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs.
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed.
In his trance
Your eyes they bleed
Your guts come forth
For his own need.




 Wherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps.
And our breath
Protecting and watching all.
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?.
Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure.
Sacred is the gift
That they have without knowing.
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time.
Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack.
Time that is short - distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun.
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?.
Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure.
Sacred is the gift
That they have without knowing.
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time.




 With chainsaw in hand
Your death I demand.
Slicing through your fat
My awaited gore attack.
Manipulating lies
Is your way of life.
Riding on cheap glory
Your life is getting gory.
Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath.
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.
Slabs of fat
Lay on the ground
Ram an axe
Into your mound.
Time to pay the gruesome price
A stupid cunt we sacrifice.
Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath.
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.
Sacrificial cunt
I despise.
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies.




 What pain will it take
To satisfy your sick appetite
Go in for the kill.
Always in sight - prey
The time always right - feast
Feed on the pain - taste
Sorrow made flesh - sweet.
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe.
Shallow are words from those who starve
For a dream not their own to slash and scar.
Big words, small mind
Behind the pain you will find
A scavenger of human sorrow
Scavenger.
Abstract theory the weapon of choice
Used by scavenger of human sorrow
Scavenger.
So you have traveled far across the sea
To spread your written brand of misery.
Always in sight - prey
The time always right - feast
Feed on the pain - taste
Sorrow made flesh - sweet.
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe.

 Decapitated head licking your cunt
Sucking all the blood from your stump.
Intestinal guts taking their hold
Leaving you dead, stiff and cold.
Controlling the minds of the bloodthirsty dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head.
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell.
Lobotamised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess.
Scream bloody gore.
Scream bloody gore.
Inject the reborn terror, the blood comes spurting out
Another to control, add it to your count.
Orders to destroy, rip and tear apart
Wishing for the end, your dead is just the start.
Controlling the minds of the bloodthirsty dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head.
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell.
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess.
Scream bloody gore.
Scream bloody gore.
Armies of the dead
Hail their leader's head.
Hungry for the flesh
While it's warm and fresh.
Through the smoke who will see
Who will come out alive?
Now it's your turn to feel the pain
Now it's your turn to die.




 There is a mask
That covers up one's true intentions
Once removed
Things become very clear.
Analyze behaviour
Patterns to see beneath.
The person that is presented to you
Vulnerable through trust.
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face.
What's on the outside
Is not always all that is real
Live by caution, what I feel.
When things are reversed
People are shown for what they are.
The truth is revealed
Banish the false
Pacifying moments with an
Acquired disguise to obtain.
The things they want
By the anguish of someone else.
Materialistic motives are fulfilled
Cherish the true
Vulnerable through trust.
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face.




 Born into darkness
Where sounds portray
The images that are out
Out of reach from my sight.
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes.
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away.
In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity.
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound.
Close your eyes
And imagine to be without
What we take for granted
Every time we open our eyes.
A permanent shadow
Never to step away.
Feel the dark in the cold
Feel the warmth of the light.
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes.
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away.
In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity.
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound.




 It comes from the depths
Of a place unknown to the
Keeper of dreams.
If it could then it would steal
The sun and the moon from the sky
Beware.

Human at sight, monster at heart
Don't let it inside it could
Tear you right apart.

No guilt, it feeds in plain sight
Spirit crusher.
Stay strong and hold on tight
Spirit crusher.

Speaking in killing words
The vicious kind that crush and kill.
No mercy, it's pleasure to taste
The blood that it bled.
When it's time to feed to fulfill
The need to consume a breath.
Some will rise standing tall
Breathing out all the breath from
The voice of a soul.

Human at sight, monster at heart
Don't let it inside it could
Tear you right apart.

No guilt, it feeds in plain sight
Spirit crusher.
Stay strong and hold on tight
Spirit crusher.
Speaking in killing words
The vicious kind that crush and kill.
No mercy, it's pleasure to taste
The blood that it bled.




 Always locking the doors to your mind
Escaping the reality that surrounds you.
Using faith as an excuse to kill
A sick way of life is now revealed.
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are.
Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die.
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn.
A justified torture?
From this may others learn.
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay.
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased.
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand
Spiritual Healing.
Blinded by the twisted ways you live
Kill for religion, will the lord forgive?.
Idiocy has stricken your mind
A real life hell you will find.
All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer, a taker of life is what you are.
Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die.
Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn.
A justified torture?
From this may others learn.
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay.
Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased.
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand.




 Drifting into the lives
Seep into the soul where emotions hide.
Dark skies were beating me down
With shadows of deceit slashing at trust.
'Til it forever bleeds with doubt
With pain, with trust, is pain
When you think of me.
In your multi-dimensional mind
Try and wash the evil.
From your mind and open it
When you taste the truth
You will see like others before me.
To you I am past, a story to tell.
To you I am past, a story to tell
Tell it.
You may think you own the end
Take another close look at the script
Of sadness etched in the book
Dark skies were beating me down.
With shadows of deceit slashing at trust
'Til it forever bleeds with doubt
With pain, with trust, is pain
When you think of me.
In your multi-dimensional mind
Try and wash the evil.
From your mind and open it
When you taste the truth
You will see like others before me.
To you I am past, a story to tell.
To you I am past, a story to tell
Tell it.




 Controlling their lives
Deciding when and how they will die.
A victim of someone else's choice
The ones who suffer have no voice.
Manipulating destiny.
When it comes to living
No one seems to care
But when it comes to wanting out
Those with power
Will be there!.
Prolong the pain
How long will it last?
Suicide machine.
A request to die with dignity
Is that too much to ask?
Suicide machine.
How easy it is to deny the pain
Of someone else's suffering.
Robbed of natural abilities
In death they now seek tranquility.
In a confused state of mind
Extending agony, they must be blind.
Manipulating destiny.
When it comes to living
No one seems to care
But when it comes to wanting out
Those with power
Will be there!.
Prolong the pain
How long will it last?
Suicide machine.
A request to die with dignity
Is that too much to ask?
Suicide machine.




 I don't mean to dwell
But I can't help myself.
When I feel the vibe
And taste a memory
Of a time in life
When years seemed to stand still.

I close my eyes
And sink within myself.
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence.
When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable.
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence.
A high that can never be bought or sold.

Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time
Were invisible.

Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow.
Do you remember when
Things seemed so eternal?.
Heroes were so real
Their magic frozen in time.
The only way to learn
Is be aware and hold on tight.




 I told you once but I will say it again
When you live the flesh
It is the beginning of the end.
It will take you in
It will spit you out.
Behold the flesh
And the power it holds.
Passion is a poison
Laced with pleasure bitter-sweet
One of many faces
That hide deep beneath.
It will take you in
It will spit you out.
Behold the flesh
And the power it holds.
Touch, taste, breathe, consume
Deja-vu, already knew from the first encounter.
But now I know to let go
Of words to speak no more.
Like a wind upon your face, you can't see it
But you know it's there.
When beauty shows its ugly face
Just be prepared.
Passion burns like fire carried by the wind
The end of a time, a time to begin.
It will take you in
It will spit you out.
Behold the flesh
And the power it holds.
It builds you up one way
And tears you right back down.
A time to begin, the end of a time.
It will take you in
It will spit you out.
Behold the flesh
And the power it holds.
Touch, taste, breathe, consumed
Deja-vu, already knew from the first encounter.
But now I know to let go
Of words to speak no more.
Like a wind upon your face, you can't see it
But you know it's there
When beauty shows its ugly face
Just be prepared.




 Do you feel what I feel?
See what I see, hear what I hear?.
There is a line you must draw
Between your dream world and reality.
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe?.
Lies feed your judgement of others
Behold how the blind lead each other.
The philosopher
You know so much about nothing at all.
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall
Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released.
Your mind is not your own
What sounds more mentally stimulating
Is how you make your choice.
So you preach about how I'm supposed to be
Yet you don't know your own sexuality.
Lies feed your judgement of others
Behold how the blind lead each other.
The philosopher
You know so much about nothing at all.




 To forgive is to suffer.
Throughout our time
A thought escapes us
To enforce a word: "No”.
Holding on to pain
It may seem to some
The easy way: to say "Okay”.
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp, actions dark.
Hide the blade of the deceiver.
Enforce the words no more, be free
Alone, you might just find serenity.
To forgive is to suffer.
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life.
To forgive is to suffer
Once or twice is kind
Three or four is blind.
It is not the end, yet a way to begin
The power of words; both good and bad
The easy way: to say "Okay"
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp, actions dark
Hide the blade of the deceiver
Enforce the words no more, be free
Alone, you might just find serenity
To forgive is to suffer
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life




 Labelled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance
Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun
Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a, a bond of flesh
Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together - they absorb each other's lives
As one - they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun




 Out to find the truth
Behind the myth of
Man eating man
Finding bodies tied
Up to a stake
You cannot understand
Filled with ignorance
You watch them eat your friends
Ask for evidence
A hook right through your tits
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Trying to escape
They torture you by
Cutting off your cock
When you're dead
They'll feast upon your flesh
Your brains they'll
Eat and chop
Pray if you want
Pathetic rancid cunt
Face reality
Death your final pleasure
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces




 I want to watch you drown in your lies
The end of your masquerade
A matter of time, interwining lies
Domination, control
Feed his twisted nature
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice
Fate's patience is growning short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner
These four words, my friend
I promise you will not forget
I am one of many that see through your lies
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge
Soon to become a victim of what
You live to create and cannot have
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice
Fate's patience is growning short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy




 Mysterious object of flight
On a voyage
To correct what they have done
What we are doing
Perhaps submerged
Living in the inner most
Recesses of the planet
No choice but
To adapt to an underground world
Limiting our passages of thought
Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression
In a realm so vast
We sit among the Vacant Planets
So many worlds yet to be seen
That once have shared
The same effects that come from greed
Mass production
Perhaps submerged
Living in the inner most
Recesses of the planet
No choice but
To adapt to an underground world
Limiting our passages of thought
Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression
In a realm so vast
We sit among the Vacant Planets




 




 Transforming your mind from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made you doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut response
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery
Look through the fake from what is real
Making desicions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last
Perceiving visions that reoccur
Analyse your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul
See past the dark
And use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams
This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery




 Guilty until proven innocent
We condemn your soul and fate
Never mind the possibilities
Too busy for logic or to calculate
Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished
Without judgement, what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgement
Perception would increase a million times
Distracted by the imagination
That experiments with ease
If you could taste it, it might be addictive
Where life will crush those who defy
Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished
Without judgement, what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgement
Perception would increase a million times




 In the dark of night...
Abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping
And some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy
Unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned
It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done
There will be zero tolerance
For the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance
Fate is your deciding God
Karma comes crashing down
Leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the
Source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed
It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence
This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done




 Revengeful corpse out to kill
Smell the stench, your guts will spill
Vomit for a mind, Maggots for a cock
With his axe the corpse will chop

Zombie dwelling maggots
Now infest your head
